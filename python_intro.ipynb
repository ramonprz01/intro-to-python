    "* __What is Python?__\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated on [python.org](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/), \"Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.\" This is a more specific way of saying that Python is a general purpose programming language that can be used for tasks ranging from building graphical user interface (GUI) applications to data analytics and machine learning. In fact, Python's popularity in recent years has been driven partly due to its versatility and usage in data analytics and machine learning. It is now one of the (if not the) preferred programming language for data scientists, analysts, and researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run Python code throughout this tutorial all you need to do is to press __Shift-Enter__ and the cell where you are in will be executed. Comments in Python will be preceeded by a __#__ sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "As awesome as Python is, it cannot do everything on its own, or at least with the base functionalities it comes with. This is where the beuty of open source comes in. Because Python is free and [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), Python has a vast amount analysts, researchers and developers contributing to its development through [libraries](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-Python-library-and-what-can-I-use-it-for) that make it easier for users to get the best out of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "A library or package in Python is essentialy a compilation of code made up of functions, classes, and specific instructions that make it easier for users to complete a specific task. This is part of what is called reusable code. If you spend countless hours developing code for a specific problem, chances are that you might need to reuse the code again in the future or that someone could benefit from you creation. We will not go in detail through all of Python's libraries in this tutorial, as that would not be feasible, but we will briefly introduce some of the most useful ones for data analysis here.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __What are some of the most widely used (and important) Python Libraries?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a plethora of libraries that are used by thousands of users each days. For data analysis, however, the most important ones are NumPy, Pandas, SciKit-Learn, matplotlib, and SciPy. Below you will find a short blurb, the command you use to import each, and the standard aliases used in industry (import \"name_of_library_or_module\" as \"nickname\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: To load a library into your session you only need to run the cell once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Numpy:_\n",
    "Numpy is a scientific computing package that allows you to do fast computations using vectors, matrices, and basically a lot of linear algebra. The following code would be what you would write and execute in order to import the library into a session.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "- _pandas:_\n",
    "pandas is a library that allows us to load, merge, and manipulate dataframes (think of these as excel spreadsheets) and makes it easier for us to analyze data.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "- _scikit-Learn:_\n",
    "scikit-learn or sk-learn is one of the most widely used libraries for machine learning. Because of its versatily and wide variety of modules (think of these as sub-libraries within sk-learn), one can run almost every machine learning algorithm available with this library.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn import * # The asteric means import all modules in the library.\n",
    "```\n",
    "- _SciPy:_\n",
    "The [scipy library](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) \"provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration, interpolation, optimization, linear algebra and statistics.\"\n",

    "[Computer Hope](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/data.htm) defines \"__Data__\" in the following way: \"data is any set of characters that is gathered and translated for some purpose, usually analysis. It can be any character, including text and numbers, pictures, sound, or video. If data is not put into context, it doesn't do anything to a human or computer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, everything we do, from breathing to searching on the web, generates information in different formats and all can be classified as data. It is important to notice, however, that most of the data available in the world is unstructured, meaning not in a nice tabular format like we are used to seeing and using in excel. We'll dive into the different data types in the next lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __What is Data Analysis?__\n",
    "\n",
    "The best definition of what data analysis is comes from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis) and it says \"Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making.\" Think about it this way, whenever we try to make a decision using evidence we need to put that same evidence in a format in which we can first make sense of it, second analyze it, and third, provide actionable insight using it. This is in a way the essence of data analysis, the cyclical process that drives decision-making. More on data analysis in the following sections tutorial.\n",

To paint a better picture of how versitile variables are, think of an excel spreadsheet containing the characteristics of different buildings in the columns (e.g. floor area, address, price, # of rooms/floor, etc.) and the buildings in each row. The columns in this scenario will be the variables, and each number matching a row and a column is a data point showing the specifict characteristic of a building. This is what we refer to as tabular data or, in other words, a dataframe. Groups of variables contanining information can form a dataframe, and these variables can have none to lots of information in them. The picture below shows the example just mentioned.\n",

    "### 4. Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have looked at what data analysis is, what are variables and dataframes, and how to use Python as a calculator. In this section, we will go over the basics of data analysis by following the principles of Eploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is an initial approach to data analysis where the analyst focuses on thoroughly exploring the dataset to see if there are any interesting relationships that could be explored and/or exploited, and also to see if additional (or more interesting) questions come out after the initial view of the cleaned dataset. We will not deal with cleaning data in this tutorial, as that is a big topic in and of itself, but please keep in mind that data cleaning is one of the biggest components of the cycle of data analysis. In fact, analysts and data scientists can spend well over 50\\% of their time in a week only cleaning data. Resources on how to get started with data cleaning will be provided at the end. For now, the dataset we will be dealing with will have already been cleaned for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is by no means and exhaustive list of the steps needed for EDA but it does provide a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at the data (description of variables, data types, and distribution of the data)\n",
    "2. Look for correlations or patterns that could provide insight\n",
    "3. Visualize these patters with bar plots, scatter plots, or box plots\n",
    "4. Conduct simple statistical analysis before diving deeper\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways in which we can read files into python, and there are also many formats to read files in. The formats you will probably work with the most are csv and excel, hence, we will only focus on those two in this tutorial. To read in files we will use pandas and we will also assign the dataframes to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "path = 'home/sarah/folder1/dataset1.csv' # Example of a path\n",
    "dataframe1 = pd.read_csv(path, options...)\n",
    "\n",
    "dataframe2 = pd.read_excel(path, options...)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Notice how the file and its extension have to be named at the end of the path and also how the path needs quotations.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section we will be using the Bank Marketing Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. To read more about the dataset please visit [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing].\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most important commands for EDA are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ".head()\n",
    ".tail()\n",
    ".describe()\n",
    ".shape()\n",
    ".info()\n",
    ".isnull()\n",
    ".dropna()\n",
    ".nunique()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: The above commands are called methods, and methods are applied directly after variables, dataframes, objects, stings, etc., and they are used in the same fashion using a period after the what we are calling the method on."

We have learned how to load different libraries, create and manipulate variables, use Python as a calculator, and even load and visualize data. Our hope is that this short tutorial will help you get started with Python and hopefully encourage you to want to learn more about the language.\n",

    "Remember, data analysis is a key component of everything that sorrounds us. Businesses, academia, non-profit organizations, and many others, rely on data analysts to continue functioning efficiently. If you'd like to enhance your skills to get a promotion, start a new company, develop a personal project, or just be able to do well in one of Carey's quantitative courses, chances are that knowing how to manipulate data at will, will at the very least, help you accomplish this."

Remember, constant improvement is much better than a one day a week, 2-weeks, once a month, etc., commitment. Create your own learning path, and make sure to keep track of it. For this purpose, I have found [trello](trello.com) an outstanding resource to keep track of your projects or any other goal or project that needs to be tracked.\n",
