    "This is a short introduction to get you started running and writing Python code in less than an 2 hours. You will not need to install anything right now and will have additional (free) resources to continue your learning journey beyond this lesson.

Python is not only fun to learn and use but is also practical in the sense that it allows you to quickly scale your career without having to go back to university for another degree. Recent industry surveys have shown that [python developers](https://neuvoo.com/salary/?job=Python+Developer) make on average \\$120,000; [data scientists using python](https://neuvoo.com/salary/?job=Python+data+scientist) make around $140,000 and the list does not stop there.\n",

    "\n",
    "* __What is Python?__\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated on [python.org](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/), \"Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.\" This is a more specific way of saying that Python is a general purpose programming language that can be used for tasks ranging from building graphical user interface (GUI) applications to data analytics and machine learning. In fact, Python's popularity in recent years has been driven partly due to its versatility and usage in data analytics and machine learning. It is now one of the (if not the) preferred programming language for data scientists, analysts, and researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run Python code throughout this tutorial all you need to do is to press __Shift-Enter__ and the cell where you are in will be run. Comments in Python will be preceeded by a __#__ sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "As awesome as Python is, it cannot do everything on its own, or at least with the base functionalities it comes with. This is where the beuty of open source comes in. Because Python is free and [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), Python has a vast amount analysts, researchers and developers contributing to its development through [libraries](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-Python-library-and-what-can-I-use-it-for) that make it easier for users to get the best out of Python. We will not go in detail through all of Python's libraries in this tutorial, as that would not be feasible, but we will briefly introduce some of the most useful ones for data analysis here.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __What are some of the most widely used (and important) Python Libraries?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a plethora of libraries that are used by thousands of users each days. For data analysis, however, the most important ones are NumPy, Pandas, SciKit-Learn, matplotlib, and SciPy. Below you will find a short blurb, the command you use to import each, and the standard aliases used in industry (import \"name of library or module\" as \"nickname\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: To load a library into your session you only need to run the cell once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Numpy:_\n",
    "Numpy is a scientific computing package that allows anyone to do fast computations using vectors, matrices, and basically a lot of linear algebra. The following code would be what you would write and execute in order to import the library into a session.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "- _pandas:_\n",
    "pandas is a library that allows us to load, merge, and manipulate dataframes (think of these as excel spreadsheets) before or while we analyze our data.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "- _scikit-Learn:_\n",
    "scikit-learn or sk-learn is one of the most widely used libraries for machine learning. Because of its versatily and wide variety of modules (think of these as sub-libraries within sk-learn), one can run almost every machine learning algorithm available with this library.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn import * # The asteric means import all modules in the library.\n",
    "```\n",
    "- _SciPy:_\n",
    "The [scipy library](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) \"provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration, interpolation, optimization, linear algebra and statistics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from scipy import *\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Matplotlib:_\n",
    "As stated on matplotlib's [website](https://matplotlib.org/), \"Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.\"\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* __What is Data?__\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer Hope defines __Data__ in the following way: \"data is any set of characters that is gathered and translated for some purpose, usually analysis. It can be any character, including text and numbers, pictures, sound, or video. If data is not put into context, it doesn't do anything to a human or computer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, everything we do, from breathing to searching on the web, generates information in different formats and all can be classified as data. It is important to notice, however, that most of the data available in the world is unstructured, meanining not in a nice tabular format like we are used to with excel. We'll dive into the different data types in the next lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __What is Data Analysis?__\n",
    "\n",
    "The best definition of what data analysis is comes from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis) and it says \"Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making.\" Think about it this way, whenever we try to make a decision using evidence we need to put the evidence in a format in which we can first make sense of it, second analyze it, and third, provide actionable insight using it. This is in a way the essence of data analysis and the focus of this tutorial.\n",

    "- __Variables__\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are the fuel of any data analysis, and these same variables can represent a multitude of data types (e.g. word characters \"a, e, i, o, u\", decimal numbers \"10.65\", integers \"1, 2, 3\", etc.). To paint a better picture of what variables are, think of an excel spreadsheet containing different characteristics of a building as the columns (e.g. floor area, address, price, # of rooms/floor, etc.) and different buildings in each row. The columns in this scenario will be the variables, and each number matching a row and a column is a data point showing the specifict characteristic of a building. This is what we refer to as tabular data or, in other words, a dataframe. Groups of variables contanining information can form a dataframe, and these variables can have none to lots of information in them. The picture below shows the example just mentioned.\n",

    "Another important distinction between variables and dataframes is that both will be held with the same convention, meaning a variable like x could also represent a dataframe or any other data type we assign it to.

Another data type in Python, and probably one of the most important ones, are lists. While variables in a dataframe can represent only one data type (e.g. and integer or a string), a variable containing lists can have multiple data types in it. Let's look at all of them separately."
